# Language Specification:
This language is intended to be a simplified subset of Google's Golang. Specification details are all derived from the [Golang spec](https://go.dev/ref/spec) and the [GoLite spec](https://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~cs520/2019/project/Milestone1_Specifications.pdf), and were copied into this document, in order to clarify the ways in which I am utilizing it for this project. 

### Lexical Specification:
